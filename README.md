meteor.js app for reading dilbert comics

## What?

This app aims to replace the standard Android (iOS as well ... probably) app while keeping all of the original functionality plus some extras like:

* Better algorithm for random Dilbert strip! Whenever I used this feature (like everyday) I felt like Dilbert in the accounting: http://dilbert.com/strip/2001-10-25
* Twitter / Facebook / Google OAuth SSO - make it easy to share a strip with your friends or save your favourite ones permanently and accessible from everywhere (offline as well?!).
* etc. (Feel free to contact me if you have other ideas)

## Why?

The standard Android Dilbert app stopped working a while ago and it's still not working - "Unable to connect to server". Meanwhile I was looking for an interesting project to build some web dev skills and play around with meteor.js.

## How?

As I mentioned in the Why? section - the technology behind the project was part of the motivation behind it. Although I'm a huge fan of Clojure I also keep an eye on meteor.js and wanted to experiment with Cordova.
